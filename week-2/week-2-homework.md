# Week 2 Homework

You should create a **new repository** under your Github account named `cis16` for this assignment. Be sure to create and switch to the `gh-pages ` branch before committing any code.

## Process

Create a site to house your classwork.

Your site should consist of:

- A page for studio assignments
- A page for lab assignments (this should include links to the pages you created for the first homework assignent, and be set up so that there's a format for adding future assignments)
- A homepage with a text you feel represents you and links to the other two pages

Technical requirements:

- Include CSS and Javascript as external files
- Use relative URLs in the links between your pages

The styling of your site should relate to the text you choose for the homepage in some way. You can choose any text you'd like â€” something you've written, a poem, a tweet, a novel, etc.
